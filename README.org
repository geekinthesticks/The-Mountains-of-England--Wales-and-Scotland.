* The Mountains of England Wales and Scotland.
This project has been created with the aim of making information about
the mountains of England, Wales and Scotland accessible to Open Source
hackers.The statistical data has been derived from Chris Crocker and
Graham Jacksonâ€™s site http://www.biber.fsnet.co.uk/index.html . They
take all the credit for collating, checking and making the data
available. I hope to keep the statistical information on this site
synchronized with theirs. However, their data will always be the
definitive source.

* Objectives.
The project has a number of objectives, which may well change over time!

 - Maintain an up to date collection of the statistical data in formats that will be useful to other hackers.
 - Provide the data in the form of an SQLite database.
 - Develop a simple front end to allow sers to browse and edit the database. This will probably be written in Python.
 - Develop a simple web application that people can run on their own
servers to record details of their own ascents.


** Requirements.
The database comes with a couple of tools. In order to use them you
will need a version of Python 2.5 or greater.

*** dbcreate.py
This script creates a new blank database. it refuses to run if the
database already exists.

*** db_import.py
Imports data from the areas_4.csv and hills_4.csv files into a
pre-existing database.

Warning - any existing data will be deleted. make sure you back up
your database before using this script.

* The Database.
If you just want to use the database, you only need ukhills.db. At
present this has been loaded with data from hills_v11_v.mdb from Chris
Crocker's site.
