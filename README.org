* The Mountains of England Wales and Scotland.
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project has been created with the aim of making information about
the mountains of England, Wales and Scotland accessible to Open Source
hackers.The statistical data has been derived from Chris Crocker and
Graham Jacksonâ€™s site http://www.biber.fsnet.co.uk/index.html . They
take all the credit for collating, checking and making the data
available. I hope to keep the statistical information on this site
synchronized with theirs. However, their data will always be the
definitive source.

* Objectives.
The project has a number of objectives, which may well change over time!

 - Maintain an up to date collection of the statistical data in formats that will be useful to other hackers.
 - Provide the data in the form of an SQLite database.
 - Develop a simple front end to allow sers to browse and edit the database. This will probably be written in Python.
 - Develop a simple web application that people can run on their own
servers to record details of their own ascents.


** Requirements.
The database comes with a couple of tools. In order to use them you
will need a version of Python 2.5 or greater.

** Scripts to Create and Populate the SQLite Database.
Please note that at the moment the relative paths to the databases and
scv files are hard coded into the scripts. If you don't want to edit
the scripts, make sure that you preserve the directory structure.

*** dbcreate.py
This script creates a new blank non relational database. it refuses to
run if the database already exists.

*** dbimport.py
Imports data from the areas_4.csv and hills_4.csv files into a
pre-existing database.

Warning - any existing data will be deleted. make sure you back up
your database before using this script.

*** create-relational_database.py
This script creates a new blank relational database. it refuses to run if the
database already exists.

*** dbimportR.py
Imports data from the areas_4R.csv, hills_4R.csv, classlink_4R.csv and
arealink_4R.scv files into a pre-existing database.

* The Databases.
Field names and types correspond to those defined in Chris Crockers
Access database.

** Non Relational Database.
The database ukhills.db has been loaded with data from hills_v11_4.mdb from Chris
Crocker's site.

** Relational Database.
The SQLIte relational database (hillsR.db) corresponds to the Access
version. However, only the tables relating to hill data are
created. Tables for the user's data in the Access database are not
created in the SQLite version.

Dates and times are stored as integers in Unix Time, which is the
number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
